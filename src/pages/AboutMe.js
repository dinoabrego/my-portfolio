          I really enjoy all the different aspects of my career but I have been looking for a new path that can challenge me to grow. When I was 10 I started modifying the html of my MySpace and then continued on Tumblr. I also did my friend's pages and it was very fun to play around with all the possibilities. I went on to study a completey different career but I always wanted to properly learn to code so here I am.
